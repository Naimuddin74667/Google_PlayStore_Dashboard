# Google Playstore Dashboard
## Introduction
The **Play Store** is home to millions of applications, catering to various user needs, from entertainment and education to business and productivity. With such a diverse range of apps available, understanding the factors contributing to an app's success is essential for developers, marketers, and product managers.

In this analysis, we explore several key variables that impact the performance of apps on the Play Store, using a dataset containing information about app categories, size, user ratings, reviews, Android versions, and more. By investigating the relationships between these variables, we aim to uncover trends that can provide insights into what makes certain apps more successful than others.

This project aims to provide actionable insights for developers and stakeholders to make informed decisions about app development and marketing strategies on the Play Store. By understanding the factors that drive success, we can help create more engaging and successful apps for users worldwide.
## Problem Statement

## Data Cleaning & ETL
In this project, a comprehensive data cleaning and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process was applied to ensure data accuracy and consistency for analysis. Starting with removing duplicates and handling missing values, we standardized key columns such as app size, ratings, and installs. Additionally, we converted categorical variables (like app size categories and Android versions) to more usable formats, facilitating better analysis.

The ETL process involved transforming raw data into structured formats, categorizing app attributes, and applying necessary conversions. These steps helped prepare the dataset, making it ready for effective analysis and visualization, leading to meaningful insights into app performance on the Play Store.
